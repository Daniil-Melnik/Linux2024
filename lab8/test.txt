1. Is this the real life?
2. Is this just fantasy?
3. Caught in a landside,
4. No escape from reality
5. Open your eyes,
6. Look up to the skies and see,
7. I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
8. Because I'm easy come, easy go,
9. Little high, little low,
10. Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
11. Me, to me
